Hello! My Name is Haotian Xia (夏浩天). I am first year Statistics Master student at University of California, Irvine, advised by [Weining Shen](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/). My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Multimodal AI, and Sports Analytics. Prior to UCI, I completed my Bachelor's with Distinction in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was thankfully advised by [Yuan-Fang Wang](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/yuan-fang-wang) and [Linda Petzold](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/linda-petzold). 

I enjoy gaming and playing sports. I have been played volleyball for 17 years and was a former NCAA Division 1 student-athlete at UCSB Men's Volleyball Team with athletic scholarship. I am also a National Level of Athletes (国家一级运动员). 

If you want to dicuss sports analytics research with me, feel free to write me an email.
