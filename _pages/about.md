Hello! My name is Haotian Xia (夏浩天). I am an incoming PhD Student in Computer Science at Rice University, advised by Prof. [Hanjie Chen](https://hanjiechen.github.io/) in the Chili Lab. My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), multimodal AI, and sports analytics. I earned my master’s degree in statistics at the University of California, Irvine, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Weining Shen](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/). Prior to UCI, I completed my bachelor’s degree with distinction in computer science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by Prof. [Yuan-Fang Wang](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/yuan-fang-wang) and Prof. [Linda Petzold](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/linda-petzold). 

I enjoy gaming and sports. I started playing volleyball at the age of seven and later competed as an NCAA Division I student-athlete on the UCSB Men’s Volleyball Team with an athletic scholarship. I am also recognized as a National Level Athlete (国家一级运动员) in China.

If you’d like to discuss sports analytics research, feel free to email me.
