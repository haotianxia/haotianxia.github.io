Hello! My name is Haotian Xia (夏浩天). I am a first-year Statistics Master’s student at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Weining Shen](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/). My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Multimodal AI, and Sports Analytics. Prior to UCI, I completed my bachelor’s degree with distinction in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by [Yuan-Fang Wang](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/yuan-fang-wang) and [Linda Petzold](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/linda-petzold). 

I enjoy gaming and playing sports. I have been playing volleyball for 17 years and was a former NCAA Division 1 student-athlete on the UCSB Men’s Volleyball Team with an athletic scholarship. I am also classified as a National Level Athlete (国家一级运动员).

If you want to discuss sports analytics research with me, feel free to write me an email.
